          Therapy for men who are struggling but don’t know how to talk about
          it.<br /><br />
        </p>

        <p class="info">
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am Berta, a qualified psychotherapist and
          counsellor offering in-person sessions in Poulton-le-Fylde, as well as
          online video and telephone counselling across the UK. I specialise in
          working with men who feel stuck, overwhelmed, or disconnected, men who
          struggle to open up, process emotions, or find balance in their lives.
          I offer a safe, grounded, confidential, and judgement-free space where
          you can explore what is really going on beneath the surface, without
          being told how to feel or pressured to change immediately.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Many men are taught to push feelings down, stay
          strong, and deal with challenges alone. Over time, this can show up as
          stress, anxiety, low mood, anger, emotional numbness, or difficulties
          in relationships. In the UK, men are three times more likely to die by
          suicide than women, and suicide remains the leading cause of death for
          men under 50 (ONS, 2023). Yet men are significantly less likely to
          seek psychological support or talk about how they feel.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I support men with challenges such as anxiety,
          depression, anger, stress, confidence issues, identity questions,
          relationship difficulties, trauma, relational trauma, loneliness,
          separation and divorce, sexuality, body image, loss and grief, and
          difficulties processing emotions. If you have ever felt like you
          cannot talk about your feelings, therapy can help you develop
          emotional awareness, build stronger relationships, and reconnect with
          yourself in a practical and grounded way. I also have extensive
          experience supporting men affected by substance use and navigating
          major life transitions, stress, burnout, or loss of direction.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You do not need to have the right words or a
          clear explanation for how you feel. If you know something is not
          working and you are tired of carrying it alone, therapy can help you
          make sense of what is going on and move towards meaningful change.
