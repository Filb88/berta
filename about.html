            <p class="info">
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am a qualified psychotherapist and counsellor working face to face in Poulton-le-Fylde, as well as online and on the telephone. I am a registered member of the British Association for 
                Counselling and Psychotherapy (MBACP), the leading professional association for counselling professions. I attend regular supervision in accordance with BACP ethical framework and have a full professional indemnity insurance. 
                I engage in regular CPD. I have completed my training at Leeds Beckett University (MA Integrative Counselling, PGCert Counselling and Interpersonal Skills). I offer counselling in English and Lithuanian.
                
                <br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In addition to my work as a psychotherapist in private practice, I am a Lead Psychotherapist at Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Center. I also have a background in supporting 
                individuals with complex mental health needs. Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of assisting clients through some of the most challenging periods of their lives. My experience in addressing 
                substance use disorders, coupled with my expertise in mental health, has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of diverse client needs. I integrate the knowledge and skills gained from these roles 
                into my current psychotherapy practice, ensuring a holistic and effective approach to treatment. 
                <br>
                
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Outside of work, I love being outdoors and going on long walks. I love spending time with my friends and family and reading. I enjoy baking and trying out new recipes.
