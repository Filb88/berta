        <p class="info">
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am a qualified psychotherapist and counsellor
          working face-to-face in Poulton-le-Fylde, as well as online and via
          telephone across the UK. I am a registered member of the British
          Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (MBACP) and work in line
          with the BACP Ethical Framework. I attend regular clinical
          supervision, engage in ongoing professional development, and hold full
          professional indemnity insurance.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I completed my training at Leeds Beckett
          University, achieving an MA in Integrative Counselling, alongside a
          PGCert in Counselling and Interpersonal Skills. I offer counselling in
          both English and Lithuanian.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Before I started my private practice, I worked as
          a Lead Psychotherapist in a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre. I
          have extensive experience working with men in addiction and recovery
          and have facilitated men’s groups within recovery services. Much of my
          work has involved supporting men who have spent years suppressing
          emotions, coping through substances, or struggling silently with
          shame, anger, or low self-worth.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This work has given me a deep understanding of
          the specific pressures men face, including expectations around
          strength, control, and emotional restraint and how these pressures can
          impact mental health, relationships, and identity. I integrate the
          knowledge and experience gained from recovery services into my
          psychotherapy practice, offering an approach that is realistic,
          compassionate, and grounded in real world experience.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Outside of my work, I enjoy being outdoors,
          exercise and going on long walks. I value spending time with friends
          and family, reading, and experimenting with new recipes, simple but
          important ways of staying connected and balanced.
