            <p class="info">
                I am a qualified psychotherapist and counsellor working face to face in Leeds, as well as online and on the telephone. 
                I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (MBACP), the leading professional association for counselling professions. 
                I attend regular supervision in accordance with BACP ethical framework and have a full professional indemnity insurance. I engage in regular CPD. 
                I have completed my training at Leeds Beckett University (MA Integrative Counselling, PGCert Counselling and Interpersonal Skills). I offer counselling in English and Lithuanian.
                Before becoming a psychotherapist, I worked as a drug and alcohol practitioner and provided support to individuals with complex mental health needs. During this time, 
                I had the privilege of supporting people through some of the most challenging periods of their lives. My experience in helping clients with substance use issues, combined with my background in mental health, 
                has given me a valuable understanding of diverse client needs. I integrate the knowledge and skills acquired from these roles into my current psychotherapy practice. 
                Outside of work, I love being outdoors and going on long walks. I love spending time with my friends and family and reading. I enjoy baking and trying out new recipes.
