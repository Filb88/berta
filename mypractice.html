        <p class="info">
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am a Relational Integrative Psychotherapist.
          What it means is that I draw on a variety of approaches, including
          person-centred, psychodynamic, CBT informed, and somatic therapies, to
          tailor therapy specifically to you as a person, rather than focusing
          on a label or a symptom.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My priority is to create a safe, empathetic, and
          non-judgemental space where men can explore their emotions without
          feeling exposed. Many men I work with have been taught to bottle up
          feelings, stay strong, and cope alone, which often leads to stress,
          anxiety, low mood, anger, disconnection, or relational difficulties.
          Therapy can be a place to understand these patterns, build emotional
          awareness, and develop ways of managing life’s pressures.
          <br /><br />
          I work with men experiencing challenges such as:
          <br />• Stress, anxiety, and depression <br />• Anger and emotional
          suppression <br />• Loneliness and relational difficulties <br />•
          Identity and confidence issues <br />• Challenges in family, dating,
          or other interpersonal relationships <br />• Sexuality <br />• Body
          image issues <br />• Divorce, separation, and affairs <br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Many of the men I work with feel trapped by
          societal expectations of masculinity, repeat unhealthy relationship
          patterns, or struggle to express themselves authentically. I provide a
          practical and grounded approach to help you understand what is really
          going on beneath the surface, to explore emotions safely, to develop
          healthier ways of relating to yourself and others, and to build a life
          that feels more connected, authentic, and manageable.
          <br /><br />
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The relationship we build together is at the
          centre of my work. I see therapy as a collaborative process: I walk
          alongside you as you navigate difficult times, gain clarity, and make
          positive changes. You do not need to have the right words to start, we
          will work together at your pace, focusing on understanding and
          insight, to help you feel more grounded in your life.
