            <p class="info">
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am a Relational Integrative Psychotherapist (itâ€™s a mouthful!). It means that I draw from different therapeutic approaches, 
                including person-centered, psychodynamic, CBT, Somatic therapies, and more, to create therapy that focuses on you as a unique person first, rather than a 
                label or a symptom. My priority is to create a safe, empathetic, and judgement- free environment. I value and celebrate the difference and uniqueness of every person, and tailor my practice to your specific needs. 
                <br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I offer support for a range of difficulties, such as anxiety, depression, trauma, issues around self-esteem and confidence, 
                bereavement, divorce, body image, domestic abuse, substance use, redundancy, sexuality, loneliness, identity issues, and more.
                <br>    
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I specialize in supporting individuals who struggle to build authentic, honest, and fulfilling family and interpersonal relationships, 
                particularly those who have experienced relational trauma. I assist those who feel lonely despite being surrounded by others, who find their relationships chaotic 
                and overwhelming, or who are trapped in a cycle of toxic relationships. Whether you're navigating the complexities of dating, facing challenges in marriage, or dealing with difficult 
                relationships with your parents or children, I am here to help you discover meaningful connections with others.
                <br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The relationship that you and I will build during our work together is at the centre of my practice and will guide our work together. I see psychotherapy and counselling as 
                a collaborative process and value building strong and trusting therapeutic relationships. I take an active role in my work with clients and support them in gaining more awareness and clarity in the most difficult 
                times in their life. During our work together, I will be walking alongside you whilst you figure things out and move towards a positive change in your life.
